## About

This mobile application intends to act as a support system for the elderly and drivers interacting with Social Cooperative Robots. This application provides a comprehensive dashboard, facilitating essential services like setting up medical appointment reminders and requesting pickup services. The main goal of the app is to assist the elderly with their mobility, helping them navigate to and from home or other specified locations with the help of the robot. It also aids drivers by allowing them to guide the robot to designated places, essentially serving as a last mile service provider. Furthermore, the application enables drivers to mark the completion of a journey using location services once the user has reached their destination. In essence, the application combines user-friendly design and innovative technology to enhance the quality of life for elderly individuals, while offering useful features to drivers.
